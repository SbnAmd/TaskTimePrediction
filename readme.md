# Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting runtime characteristics of soft real-time tasks and utilizing them for task time prediction. The goal is to enhance the precision of task execution time estimation using performance counters.

## Requirements

To run this project, the kernel must be patched to the PREEMPT_RT version to support real-time scheduling policies such as `SCHED_FIFO`, `SCHED_RR`, or even `EDF` (Earliest Deadline First). These policies are essential for achieving deterministic task scheduling in real-time systems.

## Performance Events

Performance events are hardware-level metrics collected by performance counters available in modern processors. These counters provide insights into various aspects of program execution, such as:

- **Cache Misses**: The number of times data could not be found in the CPU cache, leading to slower memory access.
- **Branch Mispredictions**: The number of incorrect branch predictions made by the CPU, which can cause pipeline stalls.
- **Instruction Count**: The total number of instructions executed by the CPU.
- **CPU Cycles**: The number of clock cycles consumed during execution.
- **Memory Accesses**: The number of times memory was accessed during execution.
- **Context Switches**: The number of times the CPU switched between tasks.

These events are critical for understanding the runtime behavior of tasks and are used in this project to predict task execution times. By analyzing these metrics, we can identify bottlenecks and improve the accuracy of time prediction models.

## Current Implementation

Currently, six performance events are being used to predict and evaluate the precision of the results. These events are collected using performance counters and analyzed to improve task time prediction accuracy.

For testing purposes, some benchmarks generated by AI are being used. However, in the near future, the project will transition to using the MiBench benchmark suite for more comprehensive and standardized testing.

## Future Work

- Integration of MiBench benchmarks.
- Optimization of performance event selection for better prediction accuracy.
- Further refinement of the task time prediction model.

**Note:** Development is actively in progress, and contributions are welcome.
